# HLD Copilot

HLD Copilot is a web application that leverages the power of GPT-3.5, an advanced language model, to generate high-level designs for distributed microservices. It aims to assist developers and architects in rapidly creating initial high-level designs for their microservice-based systems.

## Features

- **High-level design generation**: HLD Copilot utilizes the GPT-3.5 language model to generate high-level designs for distributed microservices based on user-provided inputs and requirements.

- **User-friendly interface**: The web application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their requirements and interact with the system.

- **Real-time chat**: Users can have interactive conversations with the AI-powered GPT-3.5 model to discuss and refine the high-level designs. The AI responds to user queries and provides suggestions based on its training.

## Deployment

The HLD Copilot web application is deployed and accessible at the following link: [HLD Copilot](https://hld-copilot.azurewebsites.net/)

Feel free to visit the deployment and start using HLD Copilot to generate high-level designs for your distributed microservices.

## Usage

1. Access the HLD Copilot web application using the deployment link provided above.

2. Provide your system requirements, such as desired functionalities, performance expectations, scalability requirements, and any specific constraints, in the input fields.

3. Click on the "Chat with AI" button to engage in a real-time conversation with the AI-powered GPT-3.5 model. Ask questions, seek clarifications, or request suggestions to refine and improve the high-level design.

4. Review the generated high-level design presented in the chat interface. You can iterate on the conversation and make adjustments to the design as needed.

5. Customize and modify the high-level design as per your requirements. You can collaborate with the AI model to further refine the design.
