# HLD Copilot

HLD Copilot is a web application that leverages the power of GPT-3.5, an advanced language model, to generate high-level designs for distributed microservices. It aims to assist developers and architects in rapidly creating initial high-level designs for their microservice-based systems.

## Features

- **High-level design generation**: HLD Copilot utilizes the GPT-3.5 language model to generate high-level designs for distributed microservices based on user-provided inputs and requirements.

- **User-friendly interface**: The web application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their requirements and interact with the system.

- **Real-time chat**: Users can have interactive conversations with the AI-powered GPT-3.5 model to discuss and refine the high-level designs. The AI responds to user queries and provides suggestions based on its training.
